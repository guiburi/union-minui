The following guide explains how to install FinUI using macOS, without having to download additional
software. These instructions only work with 64GB microSD cards. Other sizes require partitioning
steps that this guide does not cover yet.

#################
# Prerequisites #
#################

- A new 64GB microSD card from a reputable brand
- The official Anbernic RG355XX firmware (35XX-64GB230309EN.IMG)
- A FinUI release
- A user account with administrator privileges (https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-users-groups-settings-mtusr001/mac/)
- Full Disk Access for the app "Terminal" (https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-privacy-security-settings-on-mac-mchl211c911f/13.0/mac/13.0/)

# Install FinUI #
#################

1. Connect your microSD card to your Mac

2. Start the app "Terminal"

3. Run the command "diskutil list" and identify your microSD by looking at the "SIZE" column. It is
"/dev/disk4" in this example.

4. Run the command "diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk4"

5. Unzip the RG35XX firmware to your desktop and then run the command "cd ~/Desktop"

6. Run the command "sudo dd bs=1m if=35XX-64GB230309EN.IMG of=/dev/disk4" to flash the firmware onto
your microSD. Enter your user account password if prompted. Wait.

7. Run the command "diskutil list" again and identify the largest partition on your microSD by
looking at the "SIZE" column. It is "/dev/disk4s4" in this example. Note that this path differs from
the previous path!

8. Run the command "sudo diskutil eraseVolume FAT32 ROMS /dev/disk4s4" to format that partition as
"FAT32" with the name "ROMS". Enter your user account password if prompted. Wait.

9. You should now have a "misc" and a "ROMS" disk connected to your Mac. If you do not then try to
reconnect your microSD.

10. Unzip the FinUI release to your desktop

11. From the release, copy "dmenu.bin" to the root of the "misc" disk. Then copy "MinUI.zip" and the
"Bios", "Emus", "Roms", "Saves", "Tools" folders to the root of the "ROMS" disk.

12. Finally, to clean up you microSD, run the following commands:

dot_clean -m /Volumes/misc
dot_clean -m /Volumes/ROMS
rm -fr /Volumes/misc/.fseventsd /Volumes/misc/.Spotlight-V100 /Volumes/misc/.Trashes
rm -fr /Volumes/ROMS/.fseventsd /Volumes/ROMS/.Spotlight-V100 /Volumes/ROMS/.Trashes

Done. Insert your microSD to your RG35XX and boot it up!

######################
# Update FinUI/MinUI #
######################

1. Connect your microSD card, containing your existing FinUI/MinUI installation, to your computer

2. Unzip the latest FinUI release

3. From the release, copy and replace "dmenu.bin" in the root of the "misc" disk. Then copy and
replace "MinUI.zip" and the "Bios", "Emus", "Roms", "Saves", "Tools" folders in the root of the
"ROMS" disk.

Done. Insert your microSD to your RG35XX and boot it up!
